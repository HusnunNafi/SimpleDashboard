# **Simple Dashboard**
by [Murilo Parente]

I've been looking panels of implementations and structure easy , to my surprise, I didn't found. I did this to learn a little more of AngularJS,  and also to help the community.

# [DEMO]

# Install
```
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

# Run
```
$ gulp
```

# Structure (resources/)
 - app.js - Attach all parties in a single module.
 - app.config.js - Global Configurations and Interceptors
 - js/home/ - Home controllers, routers and services
 - js/dashboard/ - Dashboard controllers, routers and services
 - views/home/ - Home views
 - views/user/ - Dashboard views
 - less/ - Style (compile all in css/app.css)
